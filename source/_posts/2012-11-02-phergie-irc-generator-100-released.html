Following our <a title="Pardon Our Dust - Phergie" href="/blog/2012/10/20/pardon-our-dust/">last post</a> regarding the new phergie-irc-parser project, we're happy to announce that the second Phergie sub-project, <strong>phergie-irc-generator</strong>, is now available. This sub-project provides a fairly fast and easy-to-use PHP-based library for programmatically generating messages conforming to the IRC protocol. You can find the source code for it on <a title="phergie/phergie-irc-generator" href="https://github.com/phergie/phergie-irc-generator">GitHub</a> and it is available on <a title="phergie/phergie-irc-generator - Packagist" href="https://packagist.org/packages/phergie/phergie-irc-generator">Packagist</a> as well.
